<h1>Identification - NIST MS Search</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    This module allows the identification of chromatographic peaks using the <a
        href="http://chemdata.nist.gov/mass-spc/ms-search/">NIST MS Search</a> program.
</p>

<p>
    NIST MS Search accepts spectra as input to its searches. Each spectrum is defined by a list of (mass, intensity)
    pairs. The module forms a query spectrum for each row in the peak list. For each peak-list row <em>P</em> it finds
    all other peak-list rows whose (average) RTs are within a specified tolerance (see <em>Spectrum RT tolerance</em>)
    of <em>P</em>'s RT. The peaks' (neutral) mass and intensity value pairs are combined to form a search spectrum for
    <em>P</em>.
</p>

<p>
    The number of peaks used to form a mass spectrum can be limited by setting the <em>Max. peaks per spectrum</em>
    parameter to a value greater than zero. If this parameter is set to <em>N</em> then the <em>N</em> rows whose RTs
    are closest to that of the row (and within the specified RT tolerance) are used to form the mass spectrum.
</p>

<p>
    The module can also be run for an individual row of the peak-list table by highlighting the row and then selecting
    <em>NIST MS Search</em> from the pop-up menu (right mouse-button click). In such cases, the mass spectrum passed to
    NIST MS Search is formed in the same way as described above.

<h4>Method Parameters</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>NIST MS Search directory</dt>
    <dd>Full path of the directory containing the NIST MS Search executable (nistms$.exe).</dd>

    <dt>Ionization method</dt>
    <dd>Type of ionization that produced the peak subjected to identification. This is used to calculate the neutral
        mass.
    </dd>

    <dt>Spectrum RT tolerance</dt>
    <dd>When forming a search spectrum for a given peak-list row, include all other rows whose (average) RT is within
        the specified tolerance of the given row.
    </dd>

    <dt>Max. peaks per spectrum</dt>
    <dd>When forming a search spectrum for a given peak-list row, include at most the specified number of peaks
        (including the current row). If a row has more than this maximum number of peaks, <em>N</em>, whose RTs are
        within the specified RT tolerance then it is the <em>N</em> rows whose RTs are closest to that of the row that
        are used to form the mass spectrum. Setting this parameter to 0 will cause it to be ignored, i.e. all peak-list
        rows within the specified RT tolerance are used to form the mass spectrum.
    </dd>

    <dt>Min. match factor</dt>
    <dd>NIST MS Search calculates a match factor (0 .. 999) between the submitted spectrum and each hit. Ignore hits
        with a match factor below the given threshold.
    </dd>

    <dt>Min. reverse match factor</dt>
    <dd>NIST MS Search calculates a <em>reverse</em> match factor (0 .. 999) between the submitted spectrum and each
        hit. Ignore hits with a reverse match factor below the given threshold.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
    This module relies on the NIST MS Search software, which is currently only available for Microsoft Windows, being
    installed.
