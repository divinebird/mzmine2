<h1>Baseline correction</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    This module performs baseline correction on raw data files. It is designed to compensate for gradual shifts in the
    chromatographic baseline by detecting the baseline and then subtracting it from the raw data intensity values. The
    module proceeds as follows for each raw data file passed to it:
</p>
<ol>
    <li> The full range of m/z values present in the raw data is divided into a series of bins of a specified width (see
        <em>m/z bin width</em>).
    </li>
    <li>For each bin a chromatogram is constucted from the raw data points whose m/z values fall within the bin. This
        chromatogram (see <em>Chromatogram type</em>) may be either the base peak chromatogram or total ion count
        (TIC) chromatogram.
    </li>
    <li>The raw intensity values of each data point in a bin are corrected by subtracting the bin's baseline.
        Subtraction of baseline intensity values proceeds according to the type of chromatogram used to determine the
        baseline.
        <p>If the base peak chromatogram was used then the corrected intensity values are calculated as follows:<br/>
            <em>I<sub>corr</sub></em> = max(0, <em>I<sub>orig</sub></em> - <em>I<sub>base</sub></em>)</p>

        <p>If the TIC chromatogram was used then the corrected intensity values are calculated as follows:<br/>
            <em>I<sub>corr</sub></em> = max(0, <em>I<sub>orig</sub></em> * (1 - <em>I<sub>base</sub></em> /
            <em>I<sub>max</sub></em>))
        </p>

        <p>where <em>I<sub>orig</sub></em>, <em>I<sub>base</sub></em>, <em>I<sub>max</sub></em> and
            <em>I<sub>corr</sub></em> are the original, baseline, maximum and corrected intensity values, respectively,
            for a given scan and m/z bin. If <em>I<sub>base</sub></em> is less or equal to zero then no correction is
            performed, i.e. <em>I<sub>corr</sub></em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>I<sub>orig</sub></em>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>A new raw data file is generated from the corrected intensity values.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Method Parameters</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Filename suffix</dt>
    <dd>The text to append to the name of the baseline corrected raw data file.</dd>

    <dt>Chromatogram type</dt>
    <dd>TIC: total ion count, i.e. summed intensities per scan, or<br/>
        Base peak intensity: maximum intensity per scan.
    </dd>

    <dt>MS-level</dt>
    <dd>MS level to which to apply correction. Select "0" for all levels.</dd>

    <dt>Smoothing</dt>
    <dd>The smoothing factor. Typically in the range 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup>. Larger values produce a smoother
        baseline.
    </dd>

    <dt>Asymmetry</dt>
    <dd>The weight (<em>p</em>) for points below the trendline. Conversely, 1-<em>p</em> is the weight applied to points
        above the trendline. For baselines use a small value of <em>p</em>.
    </dd>

    <dt>Use m/z bins</dt>
    <dd>Baselines can be calculated and data points corrected per m/z bin or to the entire raw data file. If no binning
        is performed then a single chromatogram is calculated for the entire raw data file and its baseline used to
        correct the full data file. No binning is very quick but much less accurate and so is only suitable for
        fine-tuning the smoothing and asymmetry parameters.
    </dd>

    <dt>m/z bin width</dt>
    <dd>The width of the m/z bins if binning is performed (see <em>use m/z bins</em>). Smaller bin widths result in
        longer processing times and greater memory requirements. Avoid values below 0.01.
    </dd>

    <dt>Remove source file</dt>
    <dd>Whether to remove the original raw data file once baseline correction is complete.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>This module relies on the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R statistical computing</a> software being installed
    and two "packages" being installed in R:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ptw/index.html">ptw</a>: parametric time-warping provides the
        asymmetric least-squares implementation. To install ptw run R and enter
        <pre>install.packages("ptw")</pre>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/index.html">rJava</a>: provides an interface between
        MZmine and R. To install rJava run R and enter
        <pre>install.packages("rJava")</pre>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>In order for MZmine to make use of R, various environment variables related to R and rJava must be correctly
    defined in the MZmine start-up shell-script or batch file.
</p>
