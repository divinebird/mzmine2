<h1>Identification - NIST MS Search</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    This module allows the identification of chromatographic peaks using the <a
        href="http://chemdata.nist.gov/mass-spc/ms-search/">NIST MS Search</a> program.
</p>

<p>
    NIST MS Search accepts spectra as input to its searches. Each spectrum is defined by a list of (mass, intensity)
    pairs. The module forms a search spectrum for each peak in the peak list. For each peak <em>P</em> it finds all
    other detected peaks whose RTs are within a specified tolerance (see <em>Spectrum RT tolerance</em>) of <em>P</em>'s
    RT. The peaks' (neutral) mass and intensity value pairs are combined to form a search spectrum for <em>P</em>.
</p>

<p>
    For aligned peak-lists the operation for forming spectra is extended such that for two sets of aligned peaks
    (<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>P</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>P</em><sub>3</sub>) and (<em>Q</em><sub>1</sub>,
    <em>Q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>Q</em><sub>3</sub>) the aligned peaks' RTs are considered within the tolerance if any
    corresponding pair of peaks (<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>Q</em><sub>1</sub>), (<em>P</em><sub>2</sub>,
    <em>Q</em><sub>2</sub>) or (<em>P</em><sub>3</sub>, <em>Q</em><sub>3</sub>) have RTs within the specified tolerance.
</p>

<p>
    The module can also be run for an individual row of the peak-list table by highlighting the row and then selecting
    <em>NIST MS Search</em> from the pop-up menu (right mouse-button click). In such cases, the mass spectrum passed to
    NIST MS Search will consist of a single (mass, intensity) pair for each peak in the row.
</p>

<h4>Method Parameters</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Ionization method</dt>
    <dd>Type of ionization that produced the peak subjected to identification. This is used to calculate the neutral
        mass.
    </dd>

    <dt>Spectrum RT tolerance</dt>
    <dd>When forming a search spectrum for a given peak, include all other detected peaks whose RT is within the
        specified tolerance of the given peak. Ignored when run on a single peak-list table row.
    </dd>

    <dt>Min. match factor</dt>
    <dd>NIST MS Search calculates a match factor (0 .. 999) between the submitted spectrum and each hit. Ignore hits
        with a match factor below the given threshold.
    </dd>

    <dt>Min. reverse match factor</dt>
    <dd>NIST MS Search calculates a <em>reverse</em> match factor (0 .. 999) between the submitted spectrum and each
        hit. Ignore hits with a reverse match factor below the given threshold.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
    This module relies on the NIST MS Search software, which is currently only available for Microsoft
    Windows, being installed. When MZmine 2 is started the <tt>nist.ms.search.path</tt> system property must be set to
    the full path-name of the directory in which the <tt>NISTMS$.EXE</tt> program is found.
